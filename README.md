#### Hi there, I am Jose 👋

#### Welcome to my profile. I am a data analyst with an interest in research whether it is solving real world problems or mininig insights from large data sets 🔎📂. I enjoy making visualizations and how they can be used to tell a story. After all, pictures are more memorable than words 📊📈📉.

#### In my spare time I am a runner 🏃, I love watching real football ⚽, and I am an avgeek 🛩️. 

#### Feel free to connect and say hi. I am always open to meeting people and learning from them.
